# Console-Finances

This repository showcases the app created for analyzing the financial records of a company with the financial dataset provided by client.

## Description

During this challenge I used the concepts I've learned since the start of Bootcamp along with some new JavaScript techniques that I studied as a result of the research.

I created a JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When the code is open in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

```text
Financial Analysis
----------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
Average Change: -2315.12
```

The final code is printing the analysis to the console.
